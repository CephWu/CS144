  //* (copy): In your TCP implementation, youâ€™ll use the first unassembled index as the checkpoint

  //? Why SYN consumes the first index? Why not just stream indices?
  //* It is a workaround to distinguish the ACK is either ISN or first byte in stream.
  //* Example: sender: {seqno:10,SYN:true,payload:""}  receiver: {ackno:11,ws:...}
  //* With SYN length: sender: {seqno:11,payload:"a"}  receiver: {ackno:12,ws:...}
  //* Without SYN length: sender: {seqno:10,payload:"a"}  receiver: {ackno:11,ws:...}
  //* I think the main idea is to make the notion clear, and not necessary.
