# Stanford CS144

**Since 2023-12-16 cs144/minnow made private, I use cherry pick to merge startercode from others.**

Show all commits in the merge commit:

```txt
git log df53862^..df53862
```

Cherry pick to apply the merge commits in order (not include merge commit):

```txt
git cherry-pick start..end
```
